      "text": "Pilates has a more positive reputation in Eastern Christianity and in early Christianity. There's plenty of traditions where he was basically forced. This tends to be linked to a desire to make the Jews solely responsible for Jesus's death. Which is important if you claim more direct heritage from the Roman Empire than was common in the west. Or if you just want to hate Jews.\n\nWestern traditions tend to have seen him as more guilty and often suggest he was punished in some fashion. Sometimes prosaically, an echo of the actual fact he seems to have been recalled, and sometimes mystically. There's even a tradition the gates of heaven were shut to him and he wanders the earth, effectively a more specific version of the origin of the Wandering Jew.\n\nThere's two to three distinct periods and long fallow ones with him. I've always wondered if it says something about the times he's famous in. There's certainly commonalities."

      "text": "The best Crassus story is that he was accused of meeting clandestinely with a priestess who was required to be chaste. If they had done anything to violate her chastity the punishment was severe. He defended himself by saying he was trying to buy property from her at a cheap price. Everyone agreed Crassus lusted for money more than women and he was found innocent."

I am assuming that they roughly have similar income trajectories to either their mothers or the average/median person. If you have some evidence otherwise I'd be glad to see it. Otherwise I'm just inferring from the fact that the vast majority of able bodied people are net positives economically compared to the counterfactual where they never existed."
