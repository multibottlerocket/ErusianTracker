      "text": "Pilates has a more positive reputation in Eastern Christianity and in early Christianity. There's plenty of traditions where he was basically forced. This tends to be linked to a desire to make the Jews solely responsible for Jesus's death. Which is important if you claim more direct heritage from the Roman Empire than was common in the west. Or if you just want to hate Jews.\n\nWestern traditions tend to have seen him as more guilty and often suggest he was punished in some fashion. Sometimes prosaically, an echo of the actual fact he seems to have been recalled, and sometimes mystically. There's even a tradition the gates of heaven were shut to him and he wanders the earth, effectively a more specific version of the origin of the Wandering Jew.\n\nThere's two to three distinct periods and long fallow ones with him. I've always wondered if it says something about the times he's famous in. There's certainly commonalities."

      "text": "The best Crassus story is that he was accused of meeting clandestinely with a priestess who was required to be chaste. If they had done anything to violate her chastity the punishment was severe. He defended himself by saying he was trying to buy property from her at a cheap price. Everyone agreed Crassus lusted for money more than women and he was found innocent."

By this definition Europe was free riding because it benefitted from security and failed to meet its treaty obligations. In fact by this definition Europe is still free riding.\n\nYou're describing why it's rational to free ride. Basically, the US would keep global security and Europe could not help with that and only help with its immediate threats. See, for example, how France has repeatedly tried to undercut the US with China. Even after the Ukraine invasion and under Biden France insisted on saying it would not help the US defend Asian democracies."

      "text": "> Europe is free riding global security as much as China, Japan, Brazil, Saudi Arabia or anyone else does.\n\nWe don't ship weapons to China or aided them in securing their borders or were giving them military assistance in Myanmar. Nor equivalently for Brazil. We give Saudi Arabia a lesser amount of help because it's not an ally. Japan you're right about. Though it's still slightly lesser because, unlike Europe, they didn't agree to certain contributions then ignore them.\n\n> After 9/11 European allies helped the US in Afghanistan, the attack having been in the specified area.\n\nYes. And the US has given more to Ukraine than the EU gave to the entire war on terror despite the US having no treaty obligation to Ukraine. Therefore, why do Europeans have any objection to the US pulling back? Because alliances are more than legalism.\n\n> However, during the Falkland war US did not intervene directly as that not included in the area.\n\nThe US did, however, back Britain and supply refueling, intelligence, weapons, and Britain refused further help.\n\n> Until the 20th century the US was free riding the global security maintained by the British Empire the same way.\n\nThe British Empire was a security threat to the United States, not a net contributor, until after WW2.\n\n> If there is a war against Russia in Europe, would you expect Taiwan, South Korea and Japan to contribute forces?\n\nYes.\n\n> If they are not inclined to do that, are they also free riding their alliance with the US?\n\nYes.\n\n> How about the gulf states that host US military bases, were defended by the US in 1991 and most likely would receive US help in case of a war with Iran? Are they expected to help against China and Russia if it comes to it?\n\nYes."

      "text": "> China would also describe the US as a security threat for the past 80 years, yet the rise of China would have been impossible without global trade security maintained by the US.\n\nYes. And if the British had had primary responsibility for policing American trade, and had not started wars or attacked the United States, the situations might be symmetrical. Likewise if Britain had helped the US rather than selling weapons to the Confederacy or other nations the US was at war with or providing them diplomatic cover. Britain was much less benign to the US in the 19th century than the US was to China.\n\n> The US did not help Ukraine to help Europe.\n\nYou are now arguing intentions to get around the simple fact that the statement is true. The US has done more to help Ukraine than Europe did to help in the war on terror despite Europe being treaty bound and the US not being treaty bound to help Ukraine. I could equally argue Europe got into the war on terror not to help the US but to prevent, and later avenge, their own terrorist attacks. Which did happen. I don't make such an argument though because I'm consistent about this.\n\n> In 1991 the US deployed forces to defend Saudi Arabia from a potential invasion, and helped freeing a Saudi town Iraq captured with actual American boots on the ground, and was the primary force that smashed the Iraqi army and liberated Kuwait. This is certainly larger contribution than what Europe got since WW2.\n\nSaudi Arabia allowed US troops into the country to help with the planned liberation of Kuwait which was an ally. And the idea Desert Storm was a bigger contribution than what Europe got is absurd. First, it was just monetarily less costly (though with inflation more costly) than Ukraine has gotten. Secondly US forces in Europe have been there longer over the entire period such that it adds up to a much bigger commitment. There are US troops in Europe right now to stave off invasion.\n\n> I am pretty sure Europe would provide such too.\n\nWhile I disagree with a fair amount of specifics, I agree Europe feels the US has been behaving badly. And in some ways are correct. However, Europe is behaving worse than the US even under Trump. Though the US is by no means perfect or innocent.\n\n> I think Taiwan, Japan or the Gulf states have a very different understanding about sending forces to a potential war against Russia (or in the case of the latter, against China too), and their median citizen or even politician would be surprised and less likely to do that than most Europeans.\n\nI disagree. The point about Russia is particularly ill taken considering Japan and South Korea have disputes with Russia and have been threatened by them. A fact the Europeans neither seem aware of or interested in."

      "text": "> I dispute this, although such things are difficult to measure.\n\nThe British burned down the American capital and did several other fairly hostile things. Also the territory Britain managed to keep during the American Revolution was never reclaimed. It makes up several commonwealth nations. And Britain was adding to it for almost a century afterward. But the US hasn't constructed a grievance narrative out of it.\n\n> And of course there was the Korean war with hundreds of thousands of Chinese casualties.\n\nYes, China lost soldiers intervening in a war against the United States. A war which the side China intervened to help started.\n\n> They have been in Europe longer, but there have never been as many US troops in Europe (since WW2) as what were deployed for the Gulf War\n\nDesert Storm had 470,000 troops and about 700,000 total American personnel. Europe had 300-500,000 troops and significantly more non-combat personnel up until 1990-ish when it was reduced. So if it's true it's not true by much. I agree it's different but I think standing off against a superpower with nukes is the more threatening thing.\n\n> My thesis is that the US had been doing that all around the world through much of the 20th and 21th century, and Europe is not an outlier in receiving that.\n\nIf this were true you could find similar sustained engagements around the world. You can in Japan and South Korea and basically nowhere else. There are other examples but they fail on timeline and scale.\n\n> If anything, Europe helped more in US adventures than other countries.\n\nSeveral of these are Europe defending its own colonies or international influence. The idea that France was in (say) Niger or opposing Russia there because of the US is wrong. \"More\" may be true depending on the comparison. I agree that European allies, while not perfect, have not been as bad as many in Trump's orbit think. I agree completely with this statement:\n\"Could European countries be a better allies? Sure. But a lot of them are already among the best the US has, and certainly the worst ones are not in Europe.\"\n\n> Whatever it is though, I doubt it would be worse\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about but I'm right anyway\" is a sign you're not really open to persuasion. But the likely disagreement is I basically think that actions are more important than words and that Trump saying stuff which is not translated into policy is weighed too heavily."

      "text": "I'm not sure what distinction you're trying to draw. There's a public good here and whether you define it as \"global security\" or \"security in Europe and North America\" doesn't seem especially salient to me. In either case, Europe was not contributing enough for either.\n\nMy position is: if you make an agreement, the other side keeps it, you do not, and you benefit from them keeping the agreement then you are free riding. If Europe didn't wish to make the agreement it was free not to and to bear the consequences of that.\n\nI am easier on Japan because they did not make such an agreement. So while I think they also acted in ways that weren't ideal they get off easier than Europe. I'm also especially frustrated with Europe's constant attempts to directly undermine American security and hypocrisy on the economic and political front in ways that don't really apply to Japan (but do to some extent apply to South Korea)."

      "text": "So your position is that Europe making a promise to the United States in a signed document and then failing to fulfill it doesn't count unless it's in the NATO charter? And that nothing in NATO beyond the charter exists? This is a narrow interpretation of what NATO is that you likely haven't thought through the implications of. Also, various European nations did promise to help the US with China or the Pacific then welched.\n\nI don't think either the US or Europe has an obligation to maintain general global security. I do think they owe a duty to maintaining general alliance security including countries outside NATO but inside the alliance system. I think the US acts this way and Europe doesn't but benefits from the US acting this way. For example, the US has very little shipping through the Red Sea. That was done almost entirely for Europe's benefit."

      "text": "> It is my impression - and please correct me if I'm wrong - that you're unhappy with Europe on a larger scale than that, that you feel Europe should participate in protecting the world order it profits from.\n\nNot specifically. Europe ought to participate to the maintenance of broad alliance security. This does expand beyond the reaches of NATO. For example, I want them to be contributing with policing piracy in the Red Sea and the defense of Japan. As well as economic things like avoiding ostpolitik. But it does not mean they're required to be concerned with global order writ large.\n\n> So if you have a link to that or some starting point for me to go on and my own research, I'd be interested :)\n\nThe Prague Summit, Riga Summit, and Wales Summit all produced documents of varying language which all sides agreed to. They were not binding treaties. However, they were treated as agreements and members were criticized and called out as a problem at subsequent summits for failing to meet the goals. And the US threatened to withdraw support and did not on the basis of these promises."

Or 2002, depending on what you consider an agreement vs guideline vs whatever. But definitely from 2006 there was a 2% spending pledge which Europe has never hit. The US has been complaining about this since 2002 at any rate."

      "text": "> Is your primary crux about the 2% spending that a lot of other NATO countries did not meet (and some still don't)?\n\nNo but it's one of the more salient examples of my wider point.\n\n> What do you mean here exactly?\n\nVarious ostpolitik and pro-Chinese or Iranian moves by the EU and individual nations.\n\n> In any case, I think what would make the issue clearer is if we stopped referring to countries that are part of NATO but not US or Canada as \"Europe\".\n\nI agree with this point in aggregate. The issue is that it's a minority of nations and an even smaller minority of population and economic heft. Also I don't like how Europe sometimes plays a game where they're Europe when it's convenient and individual nations when it's convenient. But broadly I do prefer a system where we acknowledge individual nation's successes or failures until such time as the EU has national economic or military policy. Which it doesn't."

It always has been because it is not, contrary to your claims, a vassal. It is not free to choose the RESULTS of its foreign policy and I can say that such a foreign policy would be disastrous for Europe."
