      "text": "I have a simpler explanation. America simply has more politics. Yes, every nation has a government. But America has more elected offices than Europe and spends far more on elections and has far longer cycles and has more subsidiarity (meaning there's more relevant stories at different levels). Further, those politics are more impactful on other countries than other countries are on the US.\n\nDo you know how long a UK election lasts? One to two months. Do you know how much they cost? A bit less than £100 million. How much news does that produce compared to an American multiyear multibillion monstrosity? And the UK doesn't really have (relevant) local governments the way the US has states. You sometimes see American professional campaigners go to Europe because they have experience in a much more intense environment and the latest technology and so are often better trained.\n\nPlus the US has more media and it's better funded than most European counterparts. And it's got contradictions and fights and an ecosystem that feeds on itself and is highly optimized for attention."
