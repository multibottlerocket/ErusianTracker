      "text": "Pilates has a more positive reputation in Eastern Christianity and in early Christianity. There's plenty of traditions where he was basically forced. This tends to be linked to a desire to make the Jews solely responsible for Jesus's death. Which is important if you claim more direct heritage from the Roman Empire than was common in the west. Or if you just want to hate Jews.\n\nWestern traditions tend to have seen him as more guilty and often suggest he was punished in some fashion. Sometimes prosaically, an echo of the actual fact he seems to have been recalled, and sometimes mystically. There's even a tradition the gates of heaven were shut to him and he wanders the earth, effectively a more specific version of the origin of the Wandering Jew.\n\nThere's two to three distinct periods and long fallow ones with him. I've always wondered if it says something about the times he's famous in. There's certainly commonalities."

      "text": "The best Crassus story is that he was accused of meeting clandestinely with a priestess who was required to be chaste. If they had done anything to violate her chastity the punishment was severe. He defended himself by saying he was trying to buy property from her at a cheap price. Everyone agreed Crassus lusted for money more than women and he was found innocent."

By this definition Europe was free riding because it benefitted from security and failed to meet its treaty obligations. In fact by this definition Europe is still free riding.\n\nYou're describing why it's rational to free ride. Basically, the US would keep global security and Europe could not help with that and only help with its immediate threats. See, for example, how France has repeatedly tried to undercut the US with China. Even after the Ukraine invasion and under Biden France insisted on saying it would not help the US defend Asian democracies."

      "text": "> Europe is free riding global security as much as China, Japan, Brazil, Saudi Arabia or anyone else does.\n\nWe don't ship weapons to China or aided them in securing their borders or were giving them military assistance in Myanmar. Nor equivalently for Brazil. We give Saudi Arabia a lesser amount of help because it's not an ally. Japan you're right about. Though it's still slightly lesser because, unlike Europe, they didn't agree to certain contributions then ignore them.\n\n> After 9/11 European allies helped the US in Afghanistan, the attack having been in the specified area.\n\nYes. And the US has given more to Ukraine than the EU gave to the entire war on terror despite the US having no treaty obligation to Ukraine. Therefore, why do Europeans have any objection to the US pulling back? Because alliances are more than legalism.\n\n> However, during the Falkland war US did not intervene directly as that not included in the area.\n\nThe US did, however, back Britain and supply refueling, intelligence, weapons, and Britain refused further help.\n\n> Until the 20th century the US was free riding the global security maintained by the British Empire the same way.\n\nThe British Empire was a security threat to the United States, not a net contributor, until after WW2.\n\n> If there is a war against Russia in Europe, would you expect Taiwan, South Korea and Japan to contribute forces?\n\nYes.\n\n> If they are not inclined to do that, are they also free riding their alliance with the US?\n\nYes.\n\n> How about the gulf states that host US military bases, were defended by the US in 1991 and most likely would receive US help in case of a war with Iran? Are they expected to help against China and Russia if it comes to it?\n\nYes."

      "text": "> China would also describe the US as a security threat for the past 80 years, yet the rise of China would have been impossible without global trade security maintained by the US.\n\nYes. And if the British had had primary responsibility for policing American trade, and had not started wars or attacked the United States, the situations might be symmetrical. Likewise if Britain had helped the US rather than selling weapons to the Confederacy or other nations the US was at war with or providing them diplomatic cover. Britain was much less benign to the US in the 19th century than the US was to China.\n\n> The US did not help Ukraine to help Europe.\n\nYou are now arguing intentions to get around the simple fact that the statement is true. The US has done more to help Ukraine than Europe did to help in the war on terror despite Europe being treaty bound and the US not being treaty bound to help Ukraine. I could equally argue Europe got into the war on terror not to help the US but to prevent, and later avenge, their own terrorist attacks. Which did happen. I don't make such an argument though because I'm consistent about this.\n\n> In 1991 the US deployed forces to defend Saudi Arabia from a potential invasion, and helped freeing a Saudi town Iraq captured with actual American boots on the ground, and was the primary force that smashed the Iraqi army and liberated Kuwait. This is certainly larger contribution than what Europe got since WW2.\n\nSaudi Arabia allowed US troops into the country to help with the planned liberation of Kuwait which was an ally. And the idea Desert Storm was a bigger contribution than what Europe got is absurd. First, it was just monetarily less costly (though with inflation more costly) than Ukraine has gotten. Secondly US forces in Europe have been there longer over the entire period such that it adds up to a much bigger commitment. There are US troops in Europe right now to stave off invasion.\n\n> I am pretty sure Europe would provide such too.\n\nWhile I disagree with a fair amount of specifics, I agree Europe feels the US has been behaving badly. And in some ways are correct. However, Europe is behaving worse than the US even under Trump. Though the US is by no means perfect or innocent.\n\n> I think Taiwan, Japan or the Gulf states have a very different understanding about sending forces to a potential war against Russia (or in the case of the latter, against China too), and their median citizen or even politician would be surprised and less likely to do that than most Europeans.\n\nI disagree. The point about Russia is particularly ill taken considering Japan and South Korea have disputes with Russia and have been threatened by them. A fact the Europeans neither seem aware of or interested in."

      "text": "> I dispute this, although such things are difficult to measure.\n\nThe British burned down the American capital and did several other fairly hostile things. Also the territory Britain managed to keep during the American Revolution was never reclaimed. It makes up several commonwealth nations. And Britain was adding to it for almost a century afterward. But the US hasn't constructed a grievance narrative out of it.\n\n> And of course there was the Korean war with hundreds of thousands of Chinese casualties.\n\nYes, China lost soldiers intervening in a war against the United States. A war which the side China intervened to help started.\n\n> They have been in Europe longer, but there have never been as many US troops in Europe (since WW2) as what were deployed for the Gulf War\n\nDesert Storm had 470,000 troops and about 700,000 total American personnel. Europe had 300-500,000 troops and significantly more non-combat personnel up until 1990-ish when it was reduced. So if it's true it's not true by much. I agree it's different but I think standing off against a superpower with nukes is the more threatening thing.\n\n> My thesis is that the US had been doing that all around the world through much of the 20th and 21th century, and Europe is not an outlier in receiving that.\n\nIf this were true you could find similar sustained engagements around the world. You can in Japan and South Korea and basically nowhere else. There are other examples but they fail on timeline and scale.\n\n> If anything, Europe helped more in US adventures than other countries.\n\nSeveral of these are Europe defending its own colonies or international influence. The idea that France was in (say) Niger or opposing Russia there because of the US is wrong. \"More\" may be true depending on the comparison. I agree that European allies, while not perfect, have not been as bad as many in Trump's orbit think. I agree completely with this statement:\n\"Could European countries be a better allies? Sure. But a lot of them are already among the best the US has, and certainly the worst ones are not in Europe.\"\n\n> Whatever it is though, I doubt it would be worse\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about but I'm right anyway\" is a sign you're not really open to persuasion. But the likely disagreement is I basically think that actions are more important than words and that Trump saying stuff which is not translated into policy is weighed too heavily."

There's a public good here and whether you define it as \"global security\" or \"security in Europe and North America\" doesn't seem especially salient to me. In either case, Europe was not contributing enough for either.\n\nMy position is: if you make an agreement, the other side keeps it, you do not, and you benefit from them keeping the agreement then you are free riding. If Europe didn't wish to make the agreement it was free not to and to bear the consequences of that.\n\nI am easier on Japan because they did not make such an agreement. So while I think they also acted in ways that weren't ideal they get off easier than Europe. I'm also especially frustrated with Europe's constant attempts to directly undermine American security and hypocrisy on the economic and political front in ways that don't really apply to Japan (but do to some extent apply to South Korea)."

      "text": "So your position is that Europe making a promise to the United States in a signed document and then failing to fulfill it doesn't count unless it's in the NATO charter? And that nothing in NATO beyond the charter exists? This is a narrow interpretation of what NATO is that you likely haven't thought through the implications of. Also, various European nations did promise to help the US with China or the Pacific then welched.\n\nI don't think either the US or Europe has an obligation to maintain general global security. I do think they owe a duty to maintaining general alliance security including countries outside NATO but inside the alliance system. I think the US acts this way and Europe doesn't but benefits from the US acting this way. For example, the US has very little shipping through the Red Sea. That was done almost entirely for Europe's benefit."

Europe ought to participate to the maintenance of broad alliance security. This does expand beyond the reaches of NATO. For example, I want them to be contributing with policing piracy in the Red Sea and the defense of Japan. As well as economic things like avoiding ostpolitik. But it does not mean they're required to be concerned with global order writ large.\n\n> So if you have a link to that or some starting point for me to go on and my own research, I'd be interested :)\n\nThe Prague Summit, Riga Summit, and Wales Summit all produced documents of varying language which all sides agreed to. They were not binding treaties. However, they were treated as agreements and members were criticized and called out as a problem at subsequent summits for failing to meet the goals. And the US threatened to withdraw support and did not on the basis of these promises."

The issue is that it's a minority of nations and an even smaller minority of population and economic heft. Also I don't like how Europe sometimes plays a game where they're Europe when it's convenient and individual nations when it's convenient. But broadly I do prefer a system where we acknowledge individual nation's successes or failures until such time as the EU has national economic or military policy. Which it doesn't."

This is just an excuse to cover up some mysterious, third reason for caring about one and not the other.\n\n1. Israel and the UAE have the same status relative to the US, a Major Non-NATO Ally.\n2. The US has no military base in Israel, just a small coordination center. It has a major military and air base in the UAE.\n3. Israel has its own missile defenses and arms industry. The UAE largely doesn't and relies on US protection from Iran both geopolitically and simply against missiles and boats.\n4. Since 2024, pro-Israel lobbying spent $6.5 million dollars while the UAE over the same period spent $24 million. If you add up other categories of spending the gap widens because of the UAE funding non-profits, think tanks, Middle Eastern studies programs at universities, etc etc.\n5. While the US does sell more arms to Israel it still sells billions to tens of billions to the UAE and it has MORE chokepoints without alternatives."

      "text": "The RSF and SAF are reliant on outside funding and arms supplies to a far greater extent than Israel. Unlike Israel, neither has a native arms industry. Both are reliant on outside countries simply to keep the lights on. Those countries are countries the US has significant influence over. Further, as poorer and weaker forces, they are less able to absorb shocks. If you define it as \"ability to resist changes in policy\" then it's quite low even before the fact that they have no ability to resist outright military coercion. Also, Israel has plausible alternatives especially in the medium to long term while Sudan does not.\n\nI have a pretty normal idea of how much the US government can affect Israel. There's a minority opinion that the US has way more influence over Israel than can be born by historical or contemporary argument. This is mimetically adaptive among people who want the US to be involved in Gaza. This includes a lot of high prestige people in certain ecosystems who set the tone. But if you look at polling numbers on things like support for Israel you'll see the opposition or idea the US controls it to that degree is a minority.\n\n> Do you think that there are any developed countries that the US has less influence over than Israel?\n\nSo given your definition this question is: \"Do I think there are any developed countries the US can change government policy in less than Israel?\"\n\nAnd the answer is that I think the US has more ability to influence policy in most of its treaty allies than in Israel (which is not a treaty ally). I see the US having about as much influence over Israel as Turkey or Thailand. So more than, for example, Russia or Kazakhstan. Less than Canada or Germany."

If you just mean the UAE is not western then I guess it depends on your definition of western but I don't tend to think that's a valid mode of analysis. What are you imagining here in either country?\n\nAnyway, I agree the UAE is not the one carrying out the acts. However, the west isn't carrying out the acts in Israel either. And western weapons are being sent into Sudan through them. Wasn't that what Gaza was supposed to mechanically do? Sanctions and weapons cut offs? That was the idea. Great, do that about Sudan and its backers (including Russia etc). Great first step (and I mean that sincerely.) And even if you just care about Gaza doesn't setting the precedent help?\n\nWhen people say \"not comparable\" what that usually means is \"comparing them makes my argument look bad so I'm going to declare it impossible.\" Not that things can't be different but you can always compare. You can compare a fish and an airplane. You'll just find they're very different."

      "text": "Israel was maintaining close ties with Russia until Russia sided with the forces that attacked them on October 7th and invited several leaders of anti-Israeli organizations' leaders to the Kremlin. The Israelis also had begun to cultivate ties with China. Both effectively abandoned them to choose Iran. They did the same to Saudi Arabia, by the way. It's possible that the Israeli public has a deep an abiding affection for the EU such that they would be upset with their government for pivoting away. But honestly I haven't seen signs of it.\n\nThe UAE has also done some balancing. But the idea that Israel couldn't switch patrons was always something that some people wanted to be true (because it meant the US had control) rather than true. In fact Israel's original security patron was the USSR.\n\nThe 50+% stat only works if you include more than the US and EU. And if you include the same countries you get something like 40% of the UAE. And the UAE is more dependent on trade overall. The percentage of GDP represented by trade is 202% for UAE vs 57% for Israel. Their government revenues (the ones they use to fund the conflict) are also largely done from oil purchases many of which go west. And they need to buy the weapons too with limited domestic production. So yeah, the UAE is FAR more exposed to sanctions and trade influence than Israel. Though Israel is exposed too. Just far less than the UAE.\n\nIt's convenient for many people to pretend Israel is unusually dependent on the west. But it's not unusually dependent. This doesn't mean there's not significant influence (there is) but in the absence of western patronage it would simply reorient."

I suspect this was a big driver. Inflation was effectively a universal tax which was then redistributed by Democrat rescue packages to their constituencies. Which they in effect said: that they were targeting help at the vulnerable who were, for the most part, by historical disadvantage (ie, Democratic priorities) rather than needs based. They explicitly said they saw it as a way to reduce disparities. It doesn't help they got very indulgent with targeted giveaways even to their rich constituents (SALT, student debt).\n\nThis naturally upset everyone not on the receiving end of such largesse who saw real loss of purchasing power. The Democrats basically gave themselves credit for aggregate statistics and thought they could ignore the people who were losing from their policies because they were politically disfavored. This seems to be a common malady in their decision making which Bill Clinton and Obama have both commented on.\n\nWe're seeing a similar thing with Trump's policies right now, by the way. Different specifics but still."

At any rate, I'll accept \"roughly stagnated.\" Whether they grew slightly or declined slightly so long as they roughly stayed the same that's sufficient.\n\nMy baseline prediction is doubling the Federal budget in giveaways has macroeconomic effects. It may not have been good policy but the people who were given the money received the money and thus changed their income level. I agree that median is zero sum and this is my point: if the median stayed roughly the same and one group was given huge giveaways then in order for the median to stay the same other people have to decline.\n\nI agree that housing costs drive all kinds of economic issues and people would have been happier with lower costs. However, I think this started prepandemic and so you can't explain the change by it. Permanent increase in service jobs pay, meanwhile, should have had effects we don't see. As to social media, I haven't looked into it but I'm default suspicious of blaming new media for social ills when we're in the grip of a panic about it. I acknowledge that's not a fully good reason but \"you have it good, Instagram just makes you envious\" strikes me as dismissive at best."

For men with no college degree, income dropped throughout the 2000s, then started increasing again after 2012, which is the opposite of what your story would predict.\n\nThat isn't what my argument would predict. You are making this into a broad racial argument when it's about what sector of the economy you participate in and where you live. A Black woman who works at a mid-sized business in Alabama is in the losers category. But you are reproducing the issue with Blue thinking that lead to the error in the first place. In fact my argument leads to an explanation for race depolarization as the effectively economic class based nature (which does not mean income but how you related to the economy) gave a common class interest to many groups.\n\n> If the Democrats are funneling money from Group A to Group B, then either Group A is bigger, or Group B is bigger. If Group A was bigger, then this would look like falling median wages (instead of rising).\n\nMedian and average wages stagnated or declined slightly under Biden. Links to graphs below. My contention is that this concealed significant changes in who was where because inflation was a universal tax and then spending unevenly supported everyone. This is, if you take a less rosy view of it, what the Biden administration said they intended to do with rhetoric about racial equality or fighting inequality. To change the composition of wealth in the country. You may support that but naturally the losers of that process would be upset.\n\nhttps://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/image-22-593x355.png\nhttps://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/33790.jpeg\nhttps://epicforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Real-Wages-Graph.png"

      "text": "I suspect because your chart is a subset of workers rather than all workers or all people/households. The Democrats under the Biden administration did this a lot. During the pandemic, for example, I remember they released a stat showing basically real wages were up by limiting it to the durable goods sector which was then experiencing a boom. In your case, that chart still shows relatively flat growth during the Biden years. But also it excludes:\nGovernment workers\nFarm and rural workers (perhaps important to understand Trump?)\nSelf-employed people, contractors, and many small business owners\nPrivate household employers\nRetired and fixed income people\nAnd potentially others but definitely those.\n\nThis is approximately a third of the workforce and an additional over 20% of the population that is retired etc and so not in the workforce. So in fact a slight majority or close to it.\n\n(I will note, in the interest of completeness, that my theory does not predict \"included in your graph/not included\" as the relevant division.)\n\nReal wages went up during the pandemic because pandemics cause labor shortages and because people who don't show up to work drop out of the labor force unless paid more to take on the risk. Additionally laptop jobs tend to be higher productivity and were less disrupted than low productivity stuff like restaurants. Compositional effects. I suspect that's why your chart shows it going down as well."
